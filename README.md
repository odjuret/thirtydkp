# ThirtyDKP

A simple, lightweight and efficient DKP and DKP management addon.

This addon is made for, and by, the guild Essential on Gehennas-EU.
We are developing this addon as a side project to fulfill the needs of our guild. Although, it is not bound to our guild in any way so there is nothing blocking others from using it as long as they understand the english language. 
Do note that the only DKP mode supported is static price bidding.

We would like to thank the author of Monolith DKP since we were heavily inspired by Monolith DKP.
